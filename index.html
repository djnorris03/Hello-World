    Hello World

  <p>
    HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and it is used for developers to build and create websites. HTML says what the website should say and do, and it does it. 
    It is a very powerful tool since most people are likely to look at a website rather than a newspaper or magazine.<br><br> I chose this class because I wanted to learn more about HTML and expand my knowlege of the web. 
    This class really entrigued me because I had very limited knowlege about HTML, and I really hope this class can help me in the future with whatever job I end up with. And it's not just HTML i'm excited about, CSS and JavaScript were also on my agenda of programming langueages I wanted to learn before college and this class will help me with that goal.
